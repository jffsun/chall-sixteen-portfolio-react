# Challenge Sixteen: React - Portfolio

## Project Description

Challenge Sixteen required us to create a portfolio react application so that potential employers can learn more about a developer and visit some of the applications that they've created. Visitors are first sent to the 'About Me' page which includes a short bio alongside a picture of the developer. They can then navigate to the 'Portfolio' tab to view 6 of the developer's projects, the 'Contact' tab to simulate sending an email to the developer, or the 'Resume' tab where they may download the developer's resume. At the footer of this portfolio are icon links to the developer's Github, LinkedIn, and Instagram.
